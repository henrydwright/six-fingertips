# Cursory glance at Cursor

All I seem to see on my Twitter/X feed (aside from copious amounts of Elon-recommended MAGA content) is mega threads from AI exponents claiming you can "just build things" no matter what your previous level of experience. It seems that AI tools have come a long way and AI-assisted software development almost the most of any of these tools.

With possible redundancy staring me down, I thought now is the time to throw off my somewhat luddite priors about the capabilities of AI and try some "vibe coding". The tool of choice for serious AI-augmented developers seems to be Cursor. For those not in the know, this is a fork of VS Code with AI magic added.
