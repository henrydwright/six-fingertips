# Cursory glance at Cursor

All I seem to see on my Twitter/X feed (aside from copious amounts of Elon-recommended MAGA content) is mega threads from AI exponents claiming you can "just build things" no matter what your previous level of experience. It seems that AI tools have come a long way and AI-assisted software development almost the most of any of these tools.

With [possible redundancy](https://www.thisisoxfordshire.co.uk/news/25219936.job-cuts-considered-nhs-chiefs-amid-oxfordshire-overhaul/) staring me down (thanks Wes), I thought now is the time to throw off my somewhat luddite priors about the capabilities of AI, embrace the cold-hard reality of linear algebra driven agents and try some so-called "vibe coding". 

The tool of choice for serious AI-augmented developers seems to be Cursor. For those not in the know, this is a fork of VS Code with AI magic added. This blog post documents my experience minute by minute with the tool.

## The brief / rules
In my day job, the phrase of the hour is strategic commissioning. Whilst the core of this concept has been around for ages (i.e. World Class Commissioning was a concept when I was still at school) the latest NHS re-organisation has thrown it back into the limelight.

[**TODO**: Include healthcare commissioning wheel from publicly available strat comm documents]

One of the key components of the healthcare commissioning wheel is understanding your population. There is an excellent dataset of public health data called [Fingertips](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/) from the Department of Health and Social Care.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could just ask natural language questions and get answers based on Fingertips data? I've called it Six Fingertips (ha!) and it needs to allow users to provide natural language queries and get accurate data / analysis out the other end.

## The knowledge
I wanted a programming language which I haven't personally used in a while so don't have much/any experience of how it works currently. C# will be my language of choice using .NET Core.

I'm also studying for an AI Engineering cert so will make use of Azure's offering of AI services.
